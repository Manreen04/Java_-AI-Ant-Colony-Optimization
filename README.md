# Java_-AI-Ant-Colony-Optimization

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is an AI algorithm inspired by how ants find the shortest path to food. Ants leave pheromones on the paths they
take, and over time, shorter paths collect more pheromones because more ants travel them faster. This helps the colony naturally discover the best
route.

In ACO, artificial ants explore different solutions. They choose paths based on pheromone levels and path quality. After each round, pheromones
are updated good solutions get stronger pheromones, and weak ones fade. This process repeats until most ants follow the best path, giving an
optimal or near-optimal solution.
